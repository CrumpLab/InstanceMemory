This is currently an internal document for the [Computational Cognition laboratory](https://crumplab.github.io) at Brooklyn College of CUNY; but, we are sharing it as a [vertical repository](https://crumplab.github.io/vertical/) on GitHub as we create it.

**Goal**: The purpose of this repository is to review issues in the general domain of instance theory and instance memory as they apply to cognition in general. Students in Crump's lab are encouraged to contribute as authors by forking this repository and making contributions to it.

**Contributions**: Currently we are working in the manuscripts folder by editing an .Rmd document compiled to a APA journal format using `papaja`. This may change as this resource grows.
